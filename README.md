# CCMathTopologyScavengerHunt
This github repo contains point clouds used in a Topology Scavenger Hunt at Macalester College described in the volume Cross-Curricular Applications for Pure Mathematics Courses.

There are 14 different points clouds of various dimensions and topological structures.  

They are in 2D (numbered 1-6), 3D (numbered 11-14), 4D (numbered 21-22), and 400D.

The 400-dimensional point clouds were created by taking a 20x20 random matrix, superimposing a 10x10 
matrix of 0s onto the matrix (this can be visualized as a black square in an image), and then moving 
the square to various positions inside the random matrix.
Vectorizing each of these random matrices results in 400-dimensional points.
In points400_1.csv, the 0s matrix is allowed to wrap horizontally.
In points400_2.csv, the 0s matrix is allowed to wrap both horizontally and vertically.
